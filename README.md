# Stacks Token Streaming Project

Welcome to the Stacks Token Streaming Project! This repository provides a practical implementation of the SIP-010 Token Streaming Protocol as part of the Stacks Developer Degree. The goal is to showcase the application of blockchain principles and smart contract development in the Stacks ecosystem.

## Overview

The Stacks Developer Degree, as outlined in [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/stacks-developer-degree/), provides a comprehensive path to becoming proficient in Stacks development. This project leverages the SIP-010 Token Streaming Protocol, which is a standardized way to facilitate streaming payments of tokens on the Stacks blockchain.

### SIP-010 Token Streaming Protocol

SIP-010 is a Stacks Improvement Proposal that defines a protocol for streaming tokens in a manner that allows continuous payment streams rather than lump-sum transfers. This is particularly useful for creating applications where ongoing payments or subscriptions are needed, such as payroll systems or subscription services.

## Features

- **Streaming Payments**: Implements the SIP-010 protocol to enable continuous token transfers over time.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Clarity smart contracts for managing token streams and ensuring secure transactions.
